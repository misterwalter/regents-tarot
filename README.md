### Introduction
The Regent's Tarot is a divination system used by Servants of The Sovereign to try to gain insight into their lives and dilemmas. It consists of drawing two kinds of triangular cards, and laying them out in the above order. Those cards each carry significant symbolic meanings, and the order that they are drawn is guided by the will of The Sovereign.

### Usage
The act of divining by this method is common, but it still carries some taboos. It is considered selfish to use this method too often, as it distracts divine attention from the all-important task of holding the world together, and as such, most will not perform this ritual more than once or twice a week. Doing so twice in a day outside of an emergency is exceptionally rare.

### The Ritual
#### Purpose

First, the diviner must clearly state who the divination is for. That person is hereafter known as the learner. The learner and the diviner can be the same person. Then the learner clearly states the question or area that they wish to have insight into. These statement's don't quite need to be verbal, but they typically are.

#### Tossing and Shuffling

The actor and icon decks are separated, and shuffled individually by the learner. In some cultures it is important to give the natural world a chance to intervene, perhaps by tossing cards into the air, and letting the currents carry them down to the table in whatever order the wind deems fit. To do otherwise is taken as egotistical, as no one shapes their own destiny. In others, tossing the cards is considered an insult to The Sovereign's strength, as It is perfectly capable or ordering things how It pleases without you relinquishing control. It is usually wise to avoid divining first when in new company, and to follow the lead of the crowd, assuming you can tolerate their methods.

Once the two decks have been mixed and prepared, the diviner should lay them one to a side in front of themselves, and begin.

#### The Sovereign

The Learner places a small lit candle, or other comparable magical effect, at the center of the surface in front of the diviner. All cards will be placed around this object, and it both represents and channels the influence of The Sovereign at the center of all that remains.

#### Drawing Actors

The diviner draws one card from the actor deck. This is the **Breaker**, which represents an inciting force or character that is breaking or changing something. It is placed on the table as indicated above.

The diviner draws one card from the actor deck. This is the **Broken**, which represents something that is being or will be acted upon by the Breaker. It is placed on the table as indicated above.

The diviner draws one card from the actor deck. This is the **Follower**, which represents those affected by the change, and those that may support or resist it. It is placed on the table as indicated above.

The diviner draws one card from the actor deck. This is the **Forgotten**, which represents an element that is lost in the struggle, and which may or may not be restorable. It is briefly placed on the table, and then returned to the deck.

The learner should take a moment to consider the meaning of these cards, and the diviner should guide them in that. No final determination needs to be made.

#### Drawing Icons
The diviner then draws the six icons in much the same fashion, with the exception that the learner and diviner should work together to interpret the cards in between each drawing. Each of the signs both changes, and is changed by, the actors that it touches. In this way, the 1st Icon affects only the follower directly, but the 2nd sign affects both the follower and the broken. These changes are sometimes representative of a chronological story, but not always.

### Actors
- **The Broken**: Weak, but driven. Willing to act, but unable to see how. Often consumed by success or failure.

- **The Friends**: Synergy and Loyalty, in service of a goal. Can be divided to their detriment.

- **The Lonely**: Independence at the cost of isolation and starvation. Spiritual or physical decrepitude.

- **The Lovers**: Loyalty and mutual support, with codependency that sustains. Unaware of the world beyond eachother.

- **The Loyal**: Pious and virtuous. Unites and divides. Blind to their own flaws.

- **The Martyr**: Power, duty, and suffering. Lives well, suffers long, dies young.

- **The Paladin**: Powerful and righteous. Destroys their enemies. Cruel and stupid.

- **The Scholar**: Intellectual and good hearted. Solves problems. Weak and unwise.

### Icons

- **Blood**: A gift or exchange of health or life.

- **Eyes**: Vision and knowledge, guidance against treachery.

- **Fire**: A Sacrifice, perhaps freely given, perhaps bitterly extracted.

- **Harvest**: A reaping. A great loss for a greater gain.

- **Haze**: Mistaken senses or instincts. Simple, accidental, or incidental deceptions.

- **Light**: Total transformation, an annihilation of what once was. A replacement.

- **Many**: Home and family. Responsibility towards dependents.

- **Mask**: Deception, often elaborate.

- **Salve**: Restoration and healing. A return to comfort and health.

- **Smile**: Friendship, courtship, trust.

- **Worms**: Transformative failure. What should have been becomes something else.

### Doing Without Cards
If you lack a full set of triangular cards, but still desire guidance, it is acceptable to roll dice or draw other cards, and apply those results to a table of cards here. Just be sure that you don't use any card more than once in a single reading.
