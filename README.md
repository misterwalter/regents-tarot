### Introduction
The Regent's Tarot is a divination system used by Servants of The Sovereign to try to gain insight into their lives and dilemmas. It consists of drawing two kinds of triangular cards, and laying them out in the above order. Those cards each carry significant symbolic meanings, and the order that they are drawn is guided by the will of The Sovereign.

### Usage
The act of divining by this method is common, but it still carries some taboos. It is considered extrememly selfish to use this method too often, as it distracts divine attention from the all-important task of holding the world together, and as such, most will not perform this ritual more than once or twice a week. Doing so twice in a day is considered taboo.
